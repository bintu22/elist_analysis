# Elist E-Commerce Company Analysis
# Overview
Founded in 2018, Elist is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products and has since expanded to a global customer base. Like most e-commerce companies, Elist sells products through their online site as well as through their mobile app. They use a variety of marketing channels to reach customers, including Email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links. Over the last few years, their more popular products have been products from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.

As a Data Analyst, I will be partnering with the head of operations, Angie, to deliver insights to teams across the company, including finance, sales, product, and marketing. My focus is to help these stakeholders understand Elistâ€™s performance so they can improve their day-to-day processes and help the company deliver top-notch products to customers around the world. 

## ERD
Elist's database structure as seen below consists of four tables: orders, customers, geo_lookup, and order_status, with a total row count of 108,127 records.

Notes:
- Focus on sales, average order value (AOV), and order count for growth rates
- For loyalty program performance, also look at average order value
- For refunds and average order value, would like to focus on how these metrics compare across Apple products. Also include number of refunds as a metric.
